## Rules

1. **"Data first" rule** - One can obtain information about the world without mathematics and statistics, but not without being able to manipulate and analyse data. By no means do I claim that sophisticated mathematical models are useless. I claim they are useless as long as they are only written on paper. The goal of data analysis, no matter its level of sophistication, is to learn more about reality. This reality is stored in data and without being able to acquire them and manipulate them, we learn nothing. Thus everything in these notes and exercises starts with real data and everything else is consideres a bonus.

1. **"No external references" rule** - More often than not, I have met lecture notes and courses in which significant portion of the content consisted of references to external sources. It has always been annoying for me to read comments in the form of "If you want to understand this, read the docs" and  "See the original paper for information on this method". I avoid comments of this type, as well and footnotes. Everything I want to say is included in the text of the notes.

1. **"No skill without practice" rule** - I do not think it is possible to acquire new skills without putting them into practice. If one wants to learn coding, reading docs is not enough - it does not stay in the mind what has not gone through a keyboard. Therefore, every note is followed by an abundant set of exercises. Some of them are very simple to solve, others not that much. But even the simple ones are worth thinking about, because in my experience, the more real coding, the better.

1. **"One dataset" rule** - The whole course uses only one data set, which consists of economic, demographic and geographical data taken mainly from the World Bank public database. The purpose of using one data set is to minimize the time spent on getting familiarized with the data. Some courses use multiple datasets for even one topic. By my experience, working with unfamiliar data can be frustrating. One may succumb to a state of mind of just performing given tasks, without learning any new information from the data. I want to avoid that. I hope that by going through the notes and the exercises, the reader can not only get coding skills, but also learn something about our world.

## Our database

1. basic
1. economy
1. demography

# Data manipulation

[HERE](https://github.com/soukupmarek-edin/soukupmarek-edin.github.io/blob/main/data_analysis/manipulation_main.html)

In this chapter, we learn how to prepare our data for further analysis. Data analysts work with data coming from various sources. Therefore, they have to be able to get them and manipulate them efficiently. We will familiarize ourselves with Python's library pandas and the tools it provides. We learn how to load data, navigate in a data table, create new columns, aggregate data and join multiple tables.
