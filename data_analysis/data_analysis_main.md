# Introduction 

## Foreword

## Rules

1. **Data first rule** - One can obtain information about the world without mathematics and statistics, but not without being able to manipulate and analyse data. This is the main motivation for me to make these notes. 
1. **No external references rule** - More often than not, I have met lecture notes and courses in which significant portion of the content consisted of references to external sources. It has always been annoying for me to read comments in the form of "If you want to understand this, read the docs" and  "See the original paper for information on this method". I avoid comments of this type, as well and footnotes. Everything I want to say is included in the text of the notes.
1. **No skill without practice rule**
1. **One dataset rule** - The whole course uses only one data set, which consists of economic and demographic data taken from the World Bank public database. The purpose of using one data set is to minimize the time spent on getting familiarized with the data. Some courses use multiple datasets for even one topic. By my experience, working with unfamiliar data can be frustrating.
