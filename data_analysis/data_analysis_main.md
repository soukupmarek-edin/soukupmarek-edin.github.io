## Rules

1. **"Data first" rule** - One can obtain information about the world without mathematics and statistics, but not without being able to manipulate and analyse data. 

1. **"No external references" rule** - More often than not, I have met lecture notes and courses in which significant portion of the content consisted of references to external sources. It has always been annoying for me to read comments in the form of "If you want to understand this, read the docs" and  "See the original paper for information on this method". I avoid comments of this type, as well and footnotes. Everything I want to say is included in the text of the notes.

1. **"No skill without practice" rule** - I do not think it is possible to acquire new skills without putting them into practice. If one wants to learn coding, reading docs is not enough - it does not stay in the mind what has not gone through a keyboard. Therefore, every note is followed by an abundant set of exercises. Some of them are very simple to solve, others not that much. But even the simple ones are worth thinking about, because in my experience, the more real coding, the better.

1. **"One dataset" rule** - The whole course uses only one data set, which consists of economic and demographic data taken from the World Bank public database. The purpose of using one data set is to minimize the time spent on getting familiarized with the data. Some courses use multiple datasets for even one topic. By my experience, working with unfamiliar data can be frustrating.

# Meeting pandas DataFrame

The central object of the pandas module is a DataFrame. A DataFrame is a table that stores our data. In addition to a simple collection such as a list or an array, a DataFrame enables us to name our rows and columns. This feature significantly improves readability of the data stored in our table. We can also easily manipulate them. 

In this section, we take the first look at the pandas DataFrame. We learn how to load data, navigate in the data frame, select only a part of your data and perform basic exploration.
